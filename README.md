## Walking Skeleton

**Start doing the [Shopping Basket][1] kata with a [walking skeleton][2].**

The most basic thing to achieve for the walking skeleton will be this:

- Continuous Integration with the tool of your choice ([Circle CI][3], [Travis CI][4], [Jenkins][5], ...).

- Web frontend with a single button that fetches from a datastore (of your choice) the items that can be added to the 
basket (two or three will be more than enough)

- Display on the screen the data fetched

- Deployment of the system into a machine (could be your own, [AWS][6], [Azure][7], ...)

- Be able to run and end to end a test that uses the button on the frontend and asserts that the information has come 
back and is being displayed (remember, it has to come back from the datastore).

After the above is completed, you can continue with the kata as usual.
